# Intro-to-DFIR

Workshop @ CPP

This will host my slides and info needed for the presentation.

Things needed:
MacOS/Linux/Windows Machine with preferred choice of forensics software.
  I will be demoing Autopsy, FTK Imager, RegRipper, and Magnet AXIOM* in the workshop. Windows is the reccomended OS- RegRipper does not have a GUI on MacOS.
